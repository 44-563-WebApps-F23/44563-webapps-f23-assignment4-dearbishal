<h3>KAIA.</h3>
<p>Yes. </p><p>[Pauses at the door.]</p> <p>Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?</p>

<h3>SOLNESS.</h3>
<p>No--I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.</p>
<p>
     [KAIA goes out again to the left.  SOLNESS remains seated,
       turning over the drawings.]
       </p>

<h3>MRS. SOLNESS.</h3>
<p>[Over beside the plants.] </p><p>I wonder if he isn't going to die now, as
well?</p>

<h3>SOLNESS.</h3>
<p>[Looks up at her.] </p><p>As well as who?</p>

<h3>MRS. SOLNESS.</h3>
<p>[Without answering.] </p> <p>Yes, yes--depend upon it, Halvard, old Brovik is
going to die too. You'll see that he will.</p>

<h3>SOLNESS.</h3>
<p>My dear Aline, ought you not to go out for a little walk?</p>

<h3>MRS. SOLNESS.</h3>
<p>Yes, I suppose I ought to.</p>

    <p>[She continues to attend the flowers.]</p>
