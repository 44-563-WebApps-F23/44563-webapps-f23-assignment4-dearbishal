KAIA.
Yes. [Pauses at the door.] Do you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?

SOLNESS.
No--I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.

     [KAIA goes out again to the left.  SOLNESS remains seated,
       turning over the drawings.

MRS. SOLNESS.
[Over beside the plants.] I wonder if he isn't going to die now, as
well?

SOLNESS.
[Looks up at her.] As well as who?

MRS. SOLNESS.
[Without answering.] Yes, yes--depend upon it, Halvard, old Brovik is
going to die too. You'll see that he will.

SOLNESS.
My dear Aline, ought you not to go out for a little walk?

MRS. SOLNESS.
Yes, I suppose I ought to.

     [She continues to attend the flowers.
